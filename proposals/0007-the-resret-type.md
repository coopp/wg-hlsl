# Return Values of Loads, Samples, and Gathers

## Introduction

In dxc a load, sample, or gather operation returns [a `%dx.types.ResRet`
value][ResRet], which is a structure containing four 32-bit values of a given
type and an `i32 status` that is used only for [CheckAccessFullyMapped].

When representing operations that will lower to these ones in LLVM IR, we need
to make some decisions about how the types will map.

[CheckAccessFullyMapped]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/checkaccessfullymapped

## Motivation

The LLVM intrinsics that map to specific DXIL operations aren't constrained to
fit in a stable binary format, so we have a fair amount of flexibility in how
we define them. We want them to be easy to work with both in the sense that
simple IR is more likely to optimize well and in the sense that we want it to
be easy to use and understand them in tests.

There are a couple of aspects of the [ResRet] types that are a bit awkward:
1. Operating on target specific named structs is unusual in LLVM IR.
2. DXIL shoehorns operations on doubles into using `ResRet.i32` and conversion
   functions.
3. [CheckAccessFullyMapped] is always present even when unused.

We'll tackle the types of the returned values first, and then discuss the check
bit slightly separately.

## Proposed solution

### Returning Values

TypedBuffer, CBuffer, and Texture loads, as well as samples and gathers, can
return 1 to 4 elements from the given resource, to a maximum of 16 bytes of
data. DXIL's modeling of this is influenced by DirectX and DXBC's history and
it generally treats these operations as returning 4 32-bit values. For 16-bit
elements the values are 16-bit values, and for 64-bit values the operations
return 4 32-bit integers and combine them with further operations.

We have a couple of options for how to represent these return types.

1. The contained type of the resource. That is, for `Buffer<float>` this would
   return a single float, `Buffer<float4>` would be a vector of 4 floats,
   `Buffer<double2>` a vector of two doubles, etc.
2. A 4-element vector of the element type, matching the shape of the DXIL
   operations for most operations (See llvm/llvm-project#104252). We would want
   to deviate from this for 64 bit types and return a 2-element vector for
   things like `Buffer<double2>` here.
3. An anonymous structure of 4-elements (See llvm/llvm-project#106645), or
   2-elements in the case of doubles.

The trade offs here are that (1) is the simplest representation in IR but the
most complex to validate and lower to DXIL operations, and (3) is arguably
messier but very simple to lower to DXIL operations. Option (2) is a middle
ground and may be the worst of both worlds.

Discuss: Which is better, (1) or (3)?

### CheckAccessFullyMapped

Operations returning a bit just for the cases when [CheckAccessFullyMapped] is
used is kind of annoying. It's somewhat telling that some of the best
documentation of this function is [an article on sampler feedback that's
telling you how to replace that pattern][Sampler Feedback]. I think it's safe
to say usage of CheckAccessFullyMapped is rare in modern shaders, and we should
take an approach that makes code that doesn't use this operation easy to work
with.

To that end, we should provide two variants of any DXIL intrinsic that can
optionally return the check bit. The variants that do provide the bit can
simply return it as an `i1` that can be used directly rather than having to
pass an `i32` "status" to a separate operation, since there's only one thing
these are used for in practice.

As an example, we could define two `llvm.dx.typedBufferLoad` operations:
```tablegen
def int_dx_typedBufferLoad
    : DefaultAttrsIntrinsic<
          [llvm_any_ty, LLVMMatchType<0>, LLVMMatchType<0>, LLVMMatchType<0>],
          [llvm_any_ty, llvm_i32_ty]>;
def int_dx_typedBufferLoad_checked
    : DefaultAttrsIntrinsic<
          [llvm_any_ty, LLVMMatchType<0>, LLVMMatchType<0>, LLVMMatchType<0>,
           llvm_i1_ty],
          [llvm_any_ty, llvm_i32_ty]>;
```
